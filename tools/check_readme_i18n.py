"""Check that the two README files stay in sync.

The failure this guards against is specific: someone edits the English README,
forgets the Chinese one, and the two drift until a reader cannot tell which is
current. Structure is checked, not prose, because the two files are deliberately
different languages.

What must match: section count and nesting, code-block count, table-row count, the
external links, and the content of machine-readable blocks (bibtex, shell commands).
What may differ: every human-readable string.

Run with ``--write`` is not offered: this script has nothing to write. A drift is a
real drift and has to be fixed in one of the two files by hand.
